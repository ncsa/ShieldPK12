    "question":"Will You Test?",
    "description": "This is a major choice you have to make. Will you provide in-school testing? There are pros and cons to this option. By providing in-school testing, you will increase access to tests for the families in your district, and you will decrease the likelihood of transmission within your school building. You will also be able to better control your knowledge of infection levels in your school.<br>However, when you test, you WILL find cases. You will have to provide careful messaging to your staff, students, and parents regarding the meaning of test results. Remember, a negative test simply means that there was not sufficient virus to be detected at that time – it is no guarantee of safety, nor is it a free pass to relax other important controls (such as masks and distancing). <br>You will also need to develop policies around testing. Who will be tested, where, when, and how? How will test results be reported? What test will be used?<br>There is no single testing protocol that will work for every school. The choices you make must be based on your circumstances, including financial and social constraints. Below, we present some considerations related to these choices, as well as some examples.",

        "description": "You should have a protocol in place as to how external test results would be reported. The process for reporting isolation and quarantine orders could be as simple as calling the school office. We recommend providing the person(s) fielding those calls be provided with basic information about how students in isolation and quarantine will be supported (such as the example here). <br>The school should also have an established format for collecting information (the number of days the person will be out, how they can be reached during that time, and, in the case of an infected person, the date of the positive test). Contact tracing within the school should happen for any person diagnosed with COVID-19 that was in the school building for 48 hours prior to the positive test. See the contact tracing flow charts (here) for more detail.<br>When a positive case has been found, Public Health will often perform contact tracing, in which any close contacts are informed 1) that they may have been exposed, 2) the day of the exposure, and 3) the regulations regarding quarantine. You should contact your local Public Health district to determine if you can help with their contact tracing process. If your local Public Health department is not currently performing contact tracing, it will fall to you to determine if anyone within your school should be notified of a potential exposure. The CDC definition of a close contact is someone who has spent at least 15 minutes (cumulative) within 6 feet of the infected individual between 48 hours prior to their diagnosis or the start of their symptoms and the start of their isolation. Among small children, that may be impossible to determine; quarantine of an entire class would be a strong precaution but might be justified.<br>One tension between preserving privacy and protecting health will arise with those who are able to identify the potential case. Teachers will likely fall into this category – they will recognize the student who is missing from their class. However, it is good practice to inform teachers that a student of theirs has tested positive, as they may need to take extra precautions to protect their family members.<br>Your school community, and the community at large, will want to know about cases within your school. How you inform them can vary, but it must, at minimum, preserve the privacy of any detected cases. That means that information should be shared publicly only in such a way that the identity of a case cannot be deduced. In a small school, or with specialty teachers and coaches, that can be extremely difficult. Aggregation is the best technique to use to preserve privacy. This refers to reporting results only among groups; for instance, you might report only the grade of a student testing positive.<br>",
