Tasks should be clearly assigned to ensure full coverage.<br>We should note that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is primarily through aerosol and airborne droplets, not through surfaces. That said, there is a risk to spread from high-touch surfaces. Areas to be most concerned about include bathrooms (particularly door handles), drinking fountains, and elevator buttons.<br>All individuals involved in cleaning should be reminded to wear gloves and masks.  They should avoid touching their faces while wearing masks. Washing hands after or in between use of gloves is recommended. Signage next to cleaning supplies is recommended to help with compliance.",
