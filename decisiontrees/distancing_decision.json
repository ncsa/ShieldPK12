      "question": "Will you manage groupings/ pods/ bubbles/ networks?",
      "description": "One of the most effective COVID-19 controls is limiting social networks. If someone who is infected has contact with 10 people, they are more likely to transmit the virus than someone who had contact with only 5 people. If each of those original 10 people have contact with another 10 people, the original case could potentially infect up to 100 people within 2 steps. If that grouping of 10 has no outside contacts, the number of infections is limited to 10.<br>In a school setting, what does a pod look like? It might be an entire class, which would only interact with others in the class. It might be a small group of 3-5 students who work together, attend the same classes, and agree not to mix outside their pod. The important thing to consider is that the final pod size includes all contacts of the members of the pod; creating pods and then letting them mix with multiple other pods will defeat the purpose. Once formed, the group has to agree to maintain separation from others.<br>Regardless of choice, you should have a policy around specialists providing services within the school who will be meeting with individual students, such as counselors and speech therapists. If possible, provide plexi glass barriers between specialist and student, move these meetings to larger rooms with more ventilation and space, and/or move these meetings to a virtual setting.<br>",
